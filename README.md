# UJP Template
This is a LaTeX project based on the template of [Ukrainian Journal of Physics](https://ujp.bitp.kiev.ua/index.php/ujp)

The initial file `ujp.tex` is taken from the [Information for Authors](https://ujp.bitp.kiev.ua/index.php/ujp/information/authors) page
via the UJP Template link there.

The initial file `ujp.sty` was given to me by a friend, since I couldn't properly download it from the UJP Style link
on the [Information for Authors](https://ujp.bitp.kiev.ua/index.php/ujp/information/authors) page.
